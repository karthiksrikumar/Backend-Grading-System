Hello! This is a project focused on using JSON, and creating API's

In this project, I have developed a backend API for a school management system using Node.js and Express.js. The API provides endpoints for managing students, teachers, classes, and grades, interacting with a MongoDB database using Mongoose as the ODM library.
The project involved several key aspects:

Node.js and Express.js: I utilized the Node.js runtime environment and the Express.js framework to build the RESTful API. 
These technologies were chosen for their ability to create efficient and scalable backend systems.

MongoDB and Mongoose: I worked with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, using Mongoose as the ODM library. 
Schemas were defined for the various entities in the system, and database operations were implemented to manage the data effectively.

API Design: The API endpoints were designed to be intuitive and well-structured, following best practices in API design.
This facilitates easy integration with frontend systems.
Error Handling: Error handling mechanisms were implemented to provide appropriate error messages and status codes to the client. 
This ensures a user-friendly experience and aids in debugging.

Asynchronous Programming: Asynchronous operations were handled using the async/await syntax in Node.js. 
This approach enables efficient and readable code when dealing with database queries and other I/O operations.

Data Validation: Data validation checks were incorporated to maintain data integrity. 
For example, ObjectIds were validated to ensure that only valid data is processed and stored in the database.

The API offers functionality such as creating new students and teachers, retrieving grades and classes associated with specific students and teachers, calculating student GPAs, updating grades, and handling class enrollment with proper validation of class and student IDs.
Helper functions were utilized to modularize the codebase and promote code reusability. 
These functions handle tasks such as converting grades to grade points and checking if a semester is in the past.


Where can I use the skills in this program?
Backend Development: The experience gained in building RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js can be useful in developing backend systems for various applications, 
such as e-commerce platforms, social media networks, or content management systems.

Database Management: The knowledge of working with MongoDB and Mongoose can be applied in designing database schemas, performing CRUD operations, 
and optimizing database queries for applications that require data storage and retrieval.

API Design and Integration: The understanding of designing API endpoints and documentation can be helpful in projects that involve collaboration between
multiple teams or developers, facilitating integration and maintainability.

Error Handling and Data Validation: The implementation of error handling mechanisms and data validation checks can contribute to 
building systems that handle various scenarios and ensure data integrity in real-world applications.
